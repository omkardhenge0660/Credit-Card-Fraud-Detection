This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. Due to the highly imbalanced nature of fraud datasets, 
special preprocessing techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) are used to improve model performance.

The goal of this project is to build a classification model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.
